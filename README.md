Library to control the ESRF Monochromator Controller (MoCo).

The Monochromator Controller (MoCo) is an electronic module designed to regulate the
position of an optical component in a synchrotron radiation beamline. The controller corrects
the position of the component, typically a mirror or a monochromator, by monitoring the
outgoing beam and actively compensating low frequency drifts due to thermal load changes
or mechanical instability. [Manual](doc/moco.pdf)


The library exports a Tango Device Server and general plugins for Sardana.
